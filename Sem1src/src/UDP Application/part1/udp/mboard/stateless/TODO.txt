# Here the MBoard protocols 0.0.0.x are implemented and the following is still
# to be done:

1. Windows:  Ctrl+C Handling
2. Client side: timeout is needed as the client get locked when
	attempting to receive from non-existent server
3. Handling non utf-8 input
4. Interactive prompt
5. Sever discovery using UDP multicast
6. Storing the board on file system
